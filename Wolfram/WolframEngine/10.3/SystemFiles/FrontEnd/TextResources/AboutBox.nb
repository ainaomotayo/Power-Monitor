Cell["\<\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: \
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and \
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the \
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement \
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \
at its own expense.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to \

Cell["\<\
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially \
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software \

suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary \
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, \
based on the explanations below.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not \
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have \
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this \
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want \
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free \
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors \
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These \
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute \
copies of the library or if you modify it.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a \
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must \
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link \
other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the \
recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making \
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms \
so they know their rights.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, \
and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, \
distribute and/or modify the library.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no \
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone \
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the \
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be \
affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free \
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the \
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent \
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version \
of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in \
this license.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU \
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, \
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the \
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in \
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared \
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a \
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License \
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its \
criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax \
criteria for linking other code with the library.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does \
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. \
It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over \
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the \
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser \
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the \
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto \
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the \
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as \
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by \
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General \
Public License.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs \
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For \
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables \
many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its \
variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' \
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the \
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a \
modified version of the Library.\

Cell["\<\
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification \

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program \

The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has \

\"modification\".)\

\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making \
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source \
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition \
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the \
library.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered \
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program \
using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is \
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library \
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether \
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses \
the Library does. \
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete \
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously \

License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this \

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, \
thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such \
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you \
also meet all of these conditions:\
\>", "LicenseText"],

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that \
you changed the files and the date of any change.\

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all \
third parties under the terms of this License.\

Cell["\<\
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of \
data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other \
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a \
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply \
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever \
part of its purpose remains meaningful.\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose \
that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, \
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used \
by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the \
square root function must still compute square roots.)\

Cell["\<\
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable \
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably \
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, \
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as \
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole \
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be \
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to \
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your \
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the \
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on \
the Library.\

Cell["\<\
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with \
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or \
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this \
License.\

Cell["\<\
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License \
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must \
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the \
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. \

has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not \
make any other change in these notices.\

the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software \
interchange.\

Cell["\<\
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a \
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code \

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but \

derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this \

of such executables.\

When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that \
is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work \

the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not \
precisely defined by law.\

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts \

code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \
\"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing \

own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\

Cell["\<\
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is \
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You \
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays \

a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source \

the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able \
to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\

Cell["\<\
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A \
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library \
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library \
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified \
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified \
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\
\
\>", "LicenseText"],

Cell["\<\
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, \
to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a \
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\

Cell["\<\
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a \
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified \
materials from the same place.\

Cell["\<\
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or \
that you have already sent this user a copy.\

Cell["\<\
For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" \
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the \
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be \
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either \
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so \
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that \
component itself accompanies the executable.\

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of \
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating \
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library \
together in an executable that you distribute.\

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library \
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not \
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided \
that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the \
other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do \
these two things:\

Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be \
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.\

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of \
it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the \
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\

Cell["\<\
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library \
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to \
copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and \
will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties \

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. \
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the \
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you \
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the \
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of \
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, \
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the \
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original \
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to \
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on \
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not \
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent \
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), \
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or \
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse \
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to \
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other \
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the \
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit \
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies \
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both \
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the \
Library.\

Cell["\<\
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must : \
a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and \
b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the \
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement \
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim \
at its own expense.\

Cell["\<\
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to \
exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby \
assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights \

Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with \
respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is \
intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who \
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a \
manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. \
Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product \
offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to \
defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") \
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from \
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the \
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such \
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in \
a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply \
to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual \
property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: \

For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product \
offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If \
that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers \
warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are \
such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the \
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other \
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a \
court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the \
Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\

to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim \

is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any \
entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that \
the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software \

distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was \
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, \
Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) \

font family. Please contact us if you have such additions. Note, that in \
general, we will want such additions for the entire family, not just a single \
font, and that you'll have to keep both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera's designer, \
happy! To make sense to add glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in \

This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source systems and \
software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to use fontconfig (see \
http://www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration, selection and \
substitution; it has provisions for overriding font names and subsituting \
alternatives. An example is provided by the supplied local.conf file, which \
chooses the family Bitstream Vera for \"sans\", \"serif\" and \"monospace\".  \
Other software (e.g., the XFree86 core server) has other mechanisms for font \
substitution.\
